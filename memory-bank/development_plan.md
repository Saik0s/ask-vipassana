# Development Plan: Ask Vipassana

## Current Status
The Ask Vipassana application currently has a solid foundation with:
- Minimalist landing page with appropriate animations
- Basic chat interface with message input and display
- Backend API integration with N8N webhook
- Local storage for chat history
- Responsive design with blur effects and animations

## Next Development Priorities

### 1. First-Time User Guidance Implementation
**Priority: High**

The application needs to provide gentle guidance for first-time users to help them understand how to use the interface and what types of questions to ask.

#### Technical Approach
- Add suggested starter questions for first-time users
- Implement a welcoming message system that appears for new users
- Create subtle UI hints that guide users through their first interaction
- Store a "first visit" flag in localStorage to differentiate returning users

#### Design Considerations
- Messages should be warm, inviting, and teacher-like in tone
- Guidance should appear naturally, not intrusively
- Suggestions should reflect common Vipassana meditation questions

### 2. Meditation Timer Integration
**Priority: High**

The meditation timer is one of the core features mentioned in the project brief but is not yet implemented. This feature will enhance the user experience by allowing users to time their meditation sessions within the application.

#### Technical Approach
- Create a new `MeditationTimer` component
- Implement timer controls (start, pause, reset)
- Add gentle audio cues for session start/end
- Integrate timer UI with the chat interface as a floating element
- Store timer preferences in localStorage

#### Design Considerations
- Timer should be subtle and non-distracting
- Animations should be calming and mindful (breathing effect)
- Consider using gentle breathing animations to visualize time passing
- Integrate as a floating button within the chat interface as specified in docs

### 3. Source Reference System
**Priority: Medium**

The source reference system will add credibility to the AI responses by citing original Buddhist texts when relevant.

#### Technical Approach
- Modify the `ChatMessage` component to support citation display
- Update API response handling to process citation metadata
- Implement a subtle visual design for citations
- Consider expandable/collapsible citation details

#### Design Considerations
- Citations should be unobtrusive yet accessible
- Consider hover or click interactions for detailed citation information
- Maintain the minimalist aesthetic while adding this feature

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling & Connection States
**Priority: Medium**

Improve user experience when network issues or backend errors occur, ensuring errors are handled gracefully with calming messages.

#### Technical Approach
- Add more detailed error states in the chat container
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed requests
- Add visual feedback for connection status
- Enhance loading animations to resemble breathing
- Create calming fallback messages like "Let's take a moment to breathe and try again"

#### Design Considerations
- Error messages should be gentle, reassuring, and non-technical
- Consider providing suggested actions during error states
- Maintain the calm aesthetic even during error scenarios
- Use the error as an opportunity to remind users of mindfulness

### 5. Automatic Conversation Clearing Mechanism
**Priority: Medium**

Implement the privacy feature to automatically clear conversations after a period of inactivity.

#### Technical Approach
- Add timestamp tracking for last user interaction
- Implement a check on application load to compare current time against last activity
- Clear localStorage data if inactivity exceeds seven days
- Add a gentle notification when this happens

#### Design Considerations
- Privacy should be maintained throughout
- Users should still have manual control to clear history whenever desired
- The UI should feel fresh and renewed after an automatic clear

### 6. User Preferences
**Priority: Low**

Allow users to customize certain aspects of their experience.

#### Technical Approach
- Create a settings panel accessible via subtle icon
- Implement preferences for font size and contrast
- Add option to enable/disable certain animations
- Store preferences in localStorage

#### Design Considerations
- Settings should be minimal and focused on accessibility
- Design should follow the same mindful animation principles
- Consider how settings interact with the meditation experience

### 7. Performance Optimization
**Priority: Low**

Ensure the application runs smoothly on all devices and browsers.

#### Technical Approach
- Audit current animation performance
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimize localStorage usage
- Add browser compatibility improvements

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: User Experience Enhancements
- Implement first-time user guidance system
- Add meditation timer component
- Integrate source reference display to chat messages
- Update API handling to accommodate these features

### Phase 2: Privacy & Resilience Improvements
- Implement enhanced error handling with calming messages
- Add automatic conversation clearing after inactivity
- Improve loading states with mindful animations
- Add exponential backoff for API requests

### Phase 3: Refinement & Customization
- Add user preferences panel
- Further refine animations and transitions
- Implement accessibility improvements
- Optimize performance across devices

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility audit
- Documentation updates

## Architectural Decisions Needed
- How the meditation timer should integrate with the chat interface
- Best approach for displaying source references
- Strategy for error handling and offline capabilities
- Method for implementing first-time user guidance that feels natural

## Next Steps
1. Develop the first-time user guidance system
2. Implement the meditation timer component
3. Enhance error handling with mindful messaging
4. Update the Memory Bank with progress on these features

This plan will guide the continued development of the Ask Vipassana application, focusing on completing the core features outlined in the project brief while maintaining the minimalist, distraction-free design philosophy.
