# Ask Vipassana: Visual Style Guide

This guide describes the visual style of the "Ask Vipassana" interface, focusing on principles applicable across different applications.

## Overall Aesthetic: "Organic Minimalism"

The design embodies a sense of calm, natural simplicity, and understated elegance. It aims to create a digital space that feels like a peaceful meditation retreat – uncluttered, inviting, and conducive to reflection.

> **Key Principle:** Prioritize spaciousness and a feeling of lightness. Avoid any sharp edges, harsh colors, or distracting elements.

## Color Palette

The color scheme is inspired by nature, specifically autumn foliage and natural light. It uses a limited palette for a cohesive and harmonious feel.

- **Primary Background:** Off-white, like smooth river stones or aged paper (`#FAF9F6` or similar – very light beige). This creates a warm, inviting backdrop.
- **Secondary Background:** Muted, desaturated tan or light brown (`#E5D9C9` or similar, several shades darker than the primary). Use this for card-like elements and subtle elevation.
- **Accent Color 1:** Soft, desaturated orange (`#D2885A` as a starting point). This represents warmth and energy, like a gentle sunrise or a fallen leaf. Use sparingly for highlights, buttons, and interactive elements.
- **Accent Color 2:** Very soft, light gray, almost indistinguishable from white, used for very subtle seperators (`#F8F8F6`).
- **Text Color:** Dark brown, almost black, but with a warm undertone (`#332E2B` or similar). This provides excellent readability against the light backgrounds.
- **Neutral:** Pure white (`#FFFFFF`) is used sparingly, primarily for small details or very slight highlights.

> **Key Principle:** Colors should blend gently with each other, creating a sense of subtle depth rather than stark contrast. The overall impression should be warm and inviting.

## Typography

The typography is chosen for readability and to convey a sense of tranquility.

- **Font Family:** Prefer system fonts for optimal performance and familiarity. If custom fonts are used, choose a simple, highly legible serif (like "Lora" or "Merriweather") for body text and a slightly more rounded sans-serif (like "Inter" or "Open Sans") for headings.
- **Font Weight:** Regular (400) for most text. Use a slightly heavier weight (500 or 600) for headings, but avoid overly bold styles.
- **Font Size:** Prioritize generous font sizes for easy reading. Body text should be at least 16px, and headings should be scaled appropriately.
- **Line Height:** Use ample line height (at least 1.5) to create a sense of airiness and improve readability.
- **Letter Spacing:** Slightly increased letter spacing (0.02em to 0.05em) can enhance the feeling of spaciousness.

> **Key Principle:** The typography should feel effortless to read, contributing to the overall sense of calm.

## Spacing and Layout

The layout emphasizes white space and a sense of openness.

- **Margins:** Use generous margins around all elements. This is crucial for creating a sense of uncluttered space. The margins should be proportional to the screen size, but always ample.
- **Padding:** Use consistent and generous padding within elements (cards, buttons, etc.). This creates breathing room and prevents a cramped feel.
- **Gutters:** If using a grid system, use wide gutters (spacing between columns) to further enhance the sense of spaciousness.
- **Alignment:** Generally, favor center alignment for a balanced, meditative feel. However, left alignment can be used for longer text blocks to improve readability.
- **Vertical Rhythm:** Maintain a consistent vertical rhythm (spacing between lines and elements) to create visual harmony.

> **Key Principle:** Empty space is just as important as the elements themselves. The layout should feel breathable and unhurried.

## Shapes and Forms

The design favors soft, organic shapes over sharp angles.

- **Corners:** Use very rounded corners on all elements (cards, buttons, input fields). Aim for a "pill-shaped" aesthetic rather than sharp rectangles. A border-radius of at least 12-16px (or even larger) is recommended.
- **Buttons:** Buttons should be large, pill-shaped, and have a clear visual distinction (using the accent color) but avoid being overly prominent.
- **Cards:** Cards should have a subtle elevation effect, achieved through a very soft drop shadow or a slightly darker background. The shadow should be almost imperceptible, creating a sense of gentle floating.
- **Dividers:** Avoid harsh lines. Use subtle changes in background color, or very light, almost transparent lines, to separate sections.

> **Key Principle:** Softness and roundness are key. The shapes should feel organic and inviting.

## Imagery (Optional)

If imagery is used, it should be:

- **Nature-inspired:** Images of leaves, water, stones, or other natural elements are appropriate.
- **Abstract:** Avoid overly detailed or realistic images.
- **Desaturated:** Colors should be muted and blend with the overall color palette.
- **Sparse:** Use imagery sparingly, as a subtle accent rather than a dominant feature.
- **Overlay:** Images should *never* obscure the content - they should always be placed *behind* the text/content

> **Key Principle:** Imagery should enhance the sense of calm and connection to nature, never distract from the core content.

## Animation (Subtle)

Animations, if used, should be extremely subtle and slow, mimicking natural movements.

- **Fades:** Use gentle fade-in/fade-out transitions for elements appearing or disappearing.
- **Slides:** If elements slide in or out, the movement should be slow and smooth, with a subtle easing curve.
- **Pulsing:** A very subtle pulsing effect (slight scaling up and down) can be used for loading indicators or to draw attention to a specific element.
- **Breathing:** Slow, rhythmic changes in opacity or scale can mimic breathing patterns.

> **Key Principle:** Animations should be almost imperceptible, adding to the sense of calm rather than creating visual noise. Avoid any fast, jarring, or overly complex animations.

## Overall Feel

The design should evoke a sense of:

- **Calmness:** Like a quiet meditation space.
- **Simplicity:** Uncluttered and easy to navigate.
- **Naturalness:** Inspired by organic forms and colors.
- **Spaciousness:** Ample white space and breathing room.
- **Warmth:** Inviting and approachable.
- **Sophistication:** through simplicity and good design.

This style guide is designed to be adaptable to various contexts, providing a foundation for creating interfaces that prioritize a calm, focused, and natural user experience.
