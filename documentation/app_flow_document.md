# Ask Vipassana App Flow Document

## Introduction

This application is built as a peaceful, distraction-free chatbot designed specifically for meditation practitioners looking for authentic Vipassana Buddhist wisdom. The main goal is to provide a calm and minimalist conversational interface that delivers clear guidance on meditation techniques, Dhamma teachings, and practical spiritual advice in a teacher-like tone reminiscent of Goenka's teachings. The application emphasizes simplicity, privacy, and mindfulness while ensuring that the spiritual experience remains authentic and focused.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Upon arriving at Ask Vipassana, the user is greeted by a clean and uncluttered landing screen that immediately invites them to begin a conversation. There is no requirement for signing up or registering, allowing the user to start their interaction without any barriers. Since the experience is designed to be immediately accessible, the first interaction is simply a welcoming message accompanied by subtle, mindful animations that evoke a sense of calm. Users are informed through gentle prompts on how to begin, and the interface is designed to automatically store the current conversation context on the client side. In case a user wishes to start afresh, they have the option to manually reset the session, ensuring that data privacy is maintained without needing any further authentication or complicated registration processes.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once the conversation begins, the main view presents a minimalist chat interface that keeps the focus entirely on the dialogue. The home page is uncluttered with plenty of white space and a subtle color palette that resonates with a calm and thoughtful atmosphere. The interface prominently features the conversation area where the user exchanges messages with the chatbot. In addition to the active dialogue space, there is an unobtrusive floating button which provides access to a basic meditation timer. The design and layout are intentionally simple, with smooth animations that gently indicate transitions between messages and subtle pulses reinforcing moments like the start or pause of the timer. Navigation is straightforward, allowing users to stay immersed in the conversation without distractions from unrelated menus or notifications.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user starts typing, the chat interface becomes fully active and responsive, gently guiding them with initial prompts such as suggesting to ask about the basics of Vipassana meditation. As the user interacts with the chatbot, the responses are delivered in a teacher-like tone that is clear, profound, and adapted to the flow of the conversation. Each message appears with smooth fade transitions and subtle animations that mimic natural breathing, reinforcing the application's mindful approach. The contextual memory is maintained only for the duration of the session so that previous messages are remembered to provide continuity in guidance. Users retain full control over this context with an option to reset the conversation at any point. In addition, the integrated meditation timer is accessible through a floating button in the chat view. When activated, the timer appears as a minimalist overlay with basic start, stop, and a subtle pause control designed to accommodate brief interruptions. The overall navigation between sending a chat message, invoking the timer, and handling conversation resets is seamless, ensuring that every transition is smooth and supports the calm, focused user journey.

## Settings and Account Management

Since Ask Vipassana does not require user registration, traditional account management is not part of the experience. However, users are provided with easy-to-access controls to manage their conversation history and privacy settings. A simple control within the chat interface allows users to manually clear their chat history at any time. In alignment with the principles of privacy, the application is designed so that localStorage automatically clears the conversation data after a period of inactivity, such as seven days, ensuring that the user’s spiritual journey remains private and unencumbered. Once the user performs these actions, the interface gently returns to the main chat view, ready for a fresh start without unnecessary interruptions or complex account settings.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

During the interactive conversation, if the system encounters any error such as a delayed AI response or temporary unavailability of the N8N endpoint, the user experience is managed gracefully. The interface displays a calm and reassuring fallback message that gently communicates the issue while encouraging the user to take a moment to breathe. For example, if a response cannot be retrieved due to server issues, a message like "I'm sorry, something went wrong in retrieving a wise response. Let's take a moment to breathe and try again." is shown. The system also implements retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to be resilient against temporary failures. These error messages are designed to keep the user in a calm state while ensuring that the overall flow of the application is maintained without abrupt disruptions.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The overall journey in Ask Vipassana begins with a peaceful landing page that allows immediate access to a calming chat interface without any sign-up process. The conversation flows naturally with a teacher-like tone and is enhanced by subtle, mindful animations that echo the practices of Vipassana meditation. The user experience is designed so that every interaction feels continuous and respectful of the user's focus, while careful privacy measures ensure that chat history is stored locally and cleared automatically after inactivity or upon user request. Whether the user is engaging in a session for guidance or simply taking a moment to meditate with the integrated timer, the application wraps each phase of the experience in a seamless flow from start to finish. The end goal is a serene and supportive environment that not only provides spiritual insights but also respects the essence of mindfulness and simplicity throughout the user’s journey.
